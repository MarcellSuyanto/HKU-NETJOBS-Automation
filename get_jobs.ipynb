We’re a small, ambitious recruitment team with a big vision: to make candidate management smarter and more efficient. We’re looking for a driven AI Developer/Engineer Intern to design and build AI-powered features for our CRM—someone who can take charge, experiment, and deliver solutions with minimal oversight. \\n  Role Overview \\nAs our AI Developer/Engineer, you’ll be the brains behind creating AI-driven tools to enhance our Candidate CRM. We need a self-motivated engineer who loves coding, tinkering, and turning ideas into reality. You’ll work directly team members with passion for the project but limited dev experience—to develop features like advanced candidate search and automation, using tools you can master on your own. \\n  Key Responsibilities \\nDesign and build AI-powered features (e.g., smart candidate search, resume parsing, automated tagging, and anything you can think of!) that fit our CRM’s goals. \\nDevelop prototypes using accessible tools, APIs, or scripting (e.g., Python, ChatGPT API, Google Colab) to solve real recruitment challenges. \\nExplore and implement user-friendly AI solutions that don’t require a full dev team to maintain. \\nTest your code with sample candidate data from candidate database and refine it based on results. \\nDocument your work—code, experiments, and simple guides—so we can keep the momentum going. \\nPartner with a tech-forward recruitment manager to prioritize features and ensure they meet our recruiters’ needs. \\n\\nQualifications \\nCurrent enrollment in a program in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related STEM field. \\nA self-starter mentality: you’re comfortable learning tools, debugging, and building solo. \\nHands-on experience with coding (e.g., Python, JavaScript, or similar) and a passion for AI (no expert-level skills required—just enthusiasm to dive in). \\nA portfolio of work showcasing your development skills—think school projects, personal apps, scripts, or experiments (doesn’t need to be CRM or recruitment-related, just show us you can build stuff!). \\nFamiliarity with APIs, no-code/low-code platforms, or basic data handling (e.g., CSV files, JSON) is a plus but not mandatory. \\nAbility to break down technical ideas for a non-technical team with clarity and excitement. \\nBonus: Interest in recruitment tech, CRM/ATS, or messing around with data. \\n\\nWhat You’ll Gain \\nFull ownership to design and code AI features for a real product. \\nA chance to shine in a startup where your work shapes our work and future. \\nPractical engineering experience with tools and challenges you can tackle solo. \\nA portfolio piece to flex your development and product management skills. \\nMentorship from a founder obsessed with recruitment innovation.',\n",
